# Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (multivarite_data_analysis.ipynb) that performs clustering analysis on data from Steam for the game GTA5. It was carried out as a part of an assignment for the class IOP16A for the master of bioinformatics at KU Leuven. 
The project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify patterns and group similar data points, providing insights into the underlying structure of the data.
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from GitHub (https://github.com/mulhod/steam_reviews) and consists of numerous user reviews for popular games on the Steam platform. Given the large size of the dataset, this analysis focuses on a specific game: Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5).
